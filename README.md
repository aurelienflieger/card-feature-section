## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge aimed to practice with CSS Grid by reproducing a non-standard layout with unusual spacing.

## My process

### Built with

I used Sass for the very first time instead of vanilla CSS. Mixins especially helped with reducing the code's repetition when styling nearly identical cards with small variations.

### What I learned

While I used CSS Grid in my previous projects, this was a welcome refresher on how to use templates & areas for the placement of the cards.

### Continued development

I will improve the handling of card sizing & its natural growth with the viewport by using clamp(), notably. Currently, the sizes are not faithful to the original design.
